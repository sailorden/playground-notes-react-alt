# Notes Manager

View, create, edit, and delete small notes.

* There are a set of default notes added already (if we detect that the LocalStorage is empty)
* To Create a new blank note, press the + symbol on the bottom right hand of viewport. The new note appears at the upper top left hand of the viewport
* To Edit a note, just simply start typing into it. The webapp saves each edit to LocalStorage
* To delete a note, hit the X symbol on that respective note
